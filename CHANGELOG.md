# Changelog

Product-level changes to Frycards (Shifting Multiverse TCG). Rules-specific
changes are also tracked in the Change Log section of `docs/RULEBOOK.md`.

## Unreleased

### Added

- CI pipeline (GitHub Actions): typecheck, lint, format check, engine regression
  suite, Vitest, and production build on every push/PR.
- ESLint (typescript-eslint + react-hooks) and Prettier configuration.
- Engine regression suite surfaced as per-case Vitest tests (`npm test`),
  alongside the standalone runner (`npm run test:engine`).
- Leader-vs-Leader matchup matrix in the balance simulator (`npm run sim`).
- Deck import/export codes in the deck builder.
- Match log export (copy full game log).
- Game speed setting (normal/fast CPU pacing).
- Search and filters (element, type, cost) in Collection and Deck Builder.
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` and `docs/PVP_DESIGN.md`.

### Removed

- Vestigial scaffold dependencies: `express`, `dotenv`, `@google/genai`.

## V1.7 and earlier

Rules engine and balance work tracked in `docs/RULEBOOK.md` (V1.6, V1.7):
leader damage-pipeline uniformity, Command+Surge loop and mulligan exploit
fixes, exact Feedback refunds, fair Wildcast shuffling, CPU improvements,
and leader rebalancing validated by large-sample simulation.
